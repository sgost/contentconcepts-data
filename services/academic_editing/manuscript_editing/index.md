### Types of editing

There are four main types of editing - proofreading, [copy editing](https://contentconcepts.in/services/business_editing/website_copy_editing), substantive editing, and developmental editing.

* **[Proofreading](https://contentconcepts.in/services/academic_editing/proofreading_service)** involves checking for grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors.

*   **Copy editing** improves the overall language and flow of the text.

*   **Substantive editing** focuses on the structure and content of the text.

*   **Developmental editing** makes changes to the story, characters, and themes of a manuscript.

R﻿ead more detail on the level of editing done for each type of editing.

### Steps in editing a manuscript

The first step in editing a manuscript is to look it over and identify what needs to be changed. This is followed by developmental editing, which involves making changes to the structure and content of the text. English language editing concerns improving the flow of language and overall focus of the work. Proofreading involves checking for grammatical, punctuation, and spelling errors.

### Difference between proofreading and manuscript editing

The [cost of manuscript editing services](https://contentconcepts.in/blog/how-much-does-manuscript-editing-cost-per-page-per-word/) varies depending on the type of editing required and the length of the manuscript. Developmental editing can be more expensive than proofreading. However, there are also affordable manuscript editing services available that offer quality services at a reasonable cost.

### Who can edit my manuscript?

[Manuscript editors](https://contentconcepts.in/about/) are professional editors who specialize in editing manuscripts. Native English editors are particularly sought after as they can provide an extra level of editing to ensure that the text is of the highest quality. You can find manuscript editors near you through online searches or by asking for recommendations from other writers.

### Should you Pay for an editor for your manuscript?

However, there are also factors to consider when deciding whether to pay for an editor, including the cost and the type of editing required.
