<br>[Proofreading vs language editing](https://contentconcepts.com/blog/manuscript-editing-services-for-research-papers-proofreading-copy-editing-substantive-editing-which-editing-level-should-i-select/) - Proofreading is a type of editing that focuses on correcting errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. English language editing goes beyond this to ensure that the writing is clear, concise, and effective in conveying the intended message to the target audience. It involves improving the overall flow of language, fixing awkward phrasing, and enhancing the overall readability and coherence of the writing. While proofreading is important, English language editing is essential for creating a polished and professional piece of writing.
